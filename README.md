# API-Form
This is a basic form application which sends a title and text to an API when the submit button is clicked. The submit button is only active when the check box is checked.
This was my first application where I used the fetch Web API with the POST method. 

## Things I learnt
* Retrieve data entered into a form.
* POST the data to a specified API.
* Enabling certain UI elements on conditions.
